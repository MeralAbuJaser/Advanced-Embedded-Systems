Task 01: 
a) Continuously display the temperature of the device (internal temperature sensor) on the terminalusing a timer interrupt every 0.5 secs, 
b) Using PF4button interrupt toggle all (RGB) LEDs.(PS: your program will have two interrupts)

Task 02: 
Continue with Task 01, developan user interfaceusing UART to perform the following:Enter the cmd: R: Red LED, G: Green LED, B: Blue LED, 
T: Temperature; S: status of the LEDs:Based on the command (cmd) the program should turn ON Red LED when R is entered in the terminal, etc. 
Command of ‘r’ will turn off the Red LED.’T’ reads Temperature in Centigrade, and ‘t’ read Temperature in Fahrenheit. ‘S’ read status of the RGB LEDs. 

Task 03: 
Continue with Task 02, implement the temperature-memory transfer and memory-UART transfer usinguDMA.
